## Usage

At the main route, you will see a map, provided by Leaflet, where you can navigate through the world.
When you find somewhere you would like to know the temperature status, you just click on it, and it will place a pin on the map.

Click on the search button on the right. This will bring the nearest 15 cities from where you pinned.

Click on one of the places listed to know more about the weather there.

Another tab will open, on the route /weather passing the information by query strings

If you wish to reset your search, just click anywhere else on the map and click search again.
